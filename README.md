# Coastline, Cooperation & Preferences (Stata)

This repository contains a polished Stata coding sample replicating key steps from a survey experiment on how proximity to climate hazards relates to cooperation (PGG contributions), social norms, and climate beliefs.

- `code/cc_cooperation.do` â€” clean recodes, balance checks, and OLS with robust SEs.
- Data omitted for privacy. Replace the `use` line with your local path or simulated data.
- Outputs are not committed; example commands print to console.

Methods: binary recodes via `inlist()`, robust SEs, covariate-adjusted models, tidy structure.
